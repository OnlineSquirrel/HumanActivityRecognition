### Transformations / Work performed in the run_analysis.txt
1. First figure out which columns/variables (for X_train and X_test results) we need for the final data set. They are in the features.txt
    + Loading the features.txt into a data.frame
    + Extract only Ids and Names that are related to measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    + Important disclaimer:
        + I extracted the variable names (from features.txt) that contain strings "mean()" or "std()".
        + I did not extract all columns that just had a "mean" string in it (like "angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)") since I do not think that they comply with the requirement ("only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.")
    + Apply set of transformations on the variable names - they will be used as variable names for the clean data set:
        + Get rid of probable typo "BodyBody"
        + Get rid of "()"
        + Replace "t" with Time - per features_info.txt
        + Replace "f" with Frequency - per features_info.txt
        + Expanding "Acc" to "Accelerometer" - per features_info.txt
        + Expanding "Gyro" to "Gyrometer" - per features_info.txt
        + Expanding "Mag" to "Magnitude" - per features_info.txt
    + Important Disclaimer: I consider camel-case much more readable than just lower-case labels. I decide to make the variable names camel-case.
2. Due to the structure of the underlying dataset (subjects, features and values in different datasets), I decided to firts clean up each dataset, "train" and "test", and merge them at the end.
3. Clean and subset the X_train data set
    + Load the X-train.txt into a data.frame
    + Leave only the columns for the "measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement" by using the column Ids from the step #1
    + Add a column for the subject from the subject.txt file (in the "train" folder) - Nth subject in the subject file corresponds to the Nth observation in the X_train.txt file
    + Add a column for the activity Id from the y_train.txt file (in the "train" folder) -Nth activity id in the y_train.txt file corresponds to the Nth observation in the X_train.txt file
4. Repeat the same activities for X_test.txt file:
    + Load the X-test.txt into a data.frame
    + Leave only the columns for the "measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement" by using the column Ids from the step #1
    + Add a column for the subject from the subject.txt file (in the "test" folder) - Nth subject in the subject file corresponds to the Nth observation in the X_test.txt file
    + Add a column for the activity Id from the y_test.txt file (in the "test" folder) -Nth activity id in the y_test.txt file corresponds to the Nth observation in the X_test.txt file
5. Now each of the data sets contains subjects, activities and values for the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, one for "test" obsevrvations and one for "train" observations.
6. Merge 2 data sets to one unified, for test and train observations together.
7. Replace the activity Id column with the activity names:
    + Load activity_labels.txt
    + Clean up the names:
         + Change to init-case
         + Fix typos, like laying to lying
    + Add the activityName column to the merged dataset (by using the activityId for joining)
    + Get rid of the activityId column
8. At this poin the resulting data.frame contains a tidy data for only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
9. Create a new dataset that will contain average values for each column per subject/activityName combination
    + Use ddply per subject, activityName
    + Assign names to each of the calculated columns as "avgOf"+(original column name)
    + Write data into HARAveragesValues.txt file
